            Imagine this:
        </p>
        <p>It's a perfect temperature, the sun is shining and there's a calming sea breeze. You are sat on a terrace next to the ocean eating fresh fruit and sipping an iced coffee.
            The bubble bursts and you are back in the UK but you are in Ocean Cafe, Hertford. But you have just been served the best fresh brunch and a mimosa and there's no chance of sand in your shoes.
            Who is to say which scenario is better?!
