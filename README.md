## User Experience
The primary goal of the Ocean Café website is to provide a good user experience which will ultimately attract the viewer to the Café.

### User stories
#### As a new customer to Ocean Café, I would like to know if I want to eat here.
 New customers will be directed first to the home page where it is brightly colour with images and user friendly sections to display the information they require, opening times, a peek at the type of food made and the option of a menu. The User can use the website to view the items on the menu online to decide if the menu items are tempting enough to acquire their custom. 

#### As a returning customer, I want to get a table booked
The returning customer will be able to quickly get a feel for the website through easy navigation display tabs; 'home', 'menu' and 'contact us'. The customer will click on the 'contact us link and will be directed to a user friendly form to submit an enquiry or request to the restaurant. They may also have a look at the 'men'u as the link in close proximity to the 'contact us' link.

### Ease of Use  
A positive response can be found through the websites ease of use; the website is easy to navigate for a first-time user and can provide bold information for the user to view.  
Ease of use is also applied through the websites ability to be viewed on all screen sizes, this allows the user to comfortably view the website easily and happily without struggling to view the content.

### Customer Expectations
As a customer, you would expect to see the basic elements of a café website: Menu, contact details, location, opening times and means of booking. All of which have been provided across the three webpages created, Home, Menu and Contact us.  
_Note – As this is a fictional café, the exact address location of the café is unavailable, but the town location is specified._

## Design
### Wireframes 
For creation of the wireframes, I have used draw.io which has provided clear templates for the website initial design: 

### Home Page 
![home-page](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/8c9d1866-b237-4317-9653-9bdcc4d729b1)

### Menu Page

### Contact Us Page
![contact-page](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/031d1d20-aba1-4467-98ad-26e315628ea9)

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme is created to match the theme of a beach and ocean, the colours are clear and provide good accessibility suited contrasts when used together

![colour scheme](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/e68ea61c-e290-4cb3-8a6e-9bb085d04548)

### Typography
I have used Montserrat Font consistently throughout the Ocean Café website. This font is easily readable and comprehensible which is more likely to create a positive experience for the user when reading.
Using various sizes and styles of this font, creates a sense of hierarchy and structure which can assist the user to understand the flow of the website easily and supports them to progress further within the webpage.
![font-styles-sizes](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/17ed1a3e-9b2a-4ba4-bd8b-11016ba61472)

## Features
### Responsive
The website has been made responsive of styles from mobile devices to screen widths of 1440px. Having a successfully responsive website allows maximum positive user experiences when using this website and mitigates any struggle to view the website content.

![responsive-proof](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/b33040c2-3e42-4247-9657-1ceb9f97f91f)

### Interface Design
Interface design is beneficial for the website user to understand the website content and fill the viewer with good expectations and excitement to want to dine at the cafe. 

#### Nav Bar
I created a simple style nav bar using HTML and CSS and set the styles keep the header and nav bar fixed to the top of the page.
I opted to display the 'Ocean Café' name on every page in the same font size for consistency. Any devices above 768px have fully displayed text items:

![nav-bar768px](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/a21dcf22-eb57-43d3-b3ac-34632f09d3b5)

The Nav bar options are responsive for mobile devices to include a toggle button to display the options in a column for optimised user experience. 

![nav-bar-toggled](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/02b45096-04d1-4a40-bade-363a81ebe053)

#### Footer
The footer has been created to mirror the styles used on the header and nav bar. This is for further consistency and matches the chosen colour scheme, which creates a more aesthetic appeal and makes the content more engaging. It has a simplified content structure of only social networking icons, these allow the user to open the Ocean Café website up in a new tab when clicked.

![footer-bar](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/d85ceacf-527b-4ada-b3ea-0a1da731c9cb)

#### Home Page
The home page contains a section called 'Meet Us', in which we tell the viewer a little information about ourselves with a picture to make the website more personable. Also included is a brief bit of information on the type of food/drink served at the cafe and who the cafe can accommodate.
The next section is clearly defined as a new section because of the change in background colour.
The gallery is displayed responsively, all the images displayed are either taken by myself or are sourced from Pexels

![home-page](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/d86fdaea-fe96-4352-be1f-0e1b5dfebc62)

#### Menu Page
The menu page is split into two sections, the food menu and the drink menu. The menu item is displayed in larger font and underlined and is followed by a short description of the main ingredients within the menu item. The drinks menu is styled similar to the food menu but splits the types of drinks up into more accurate sub-sections, such as smoothies and soft drinks. This will aid with user navigation and provides an ordered menu item list.
On screen sizes larger than 1024px, images are aligned to the right of the page and spaced evenly to display a colourful image when the user scrolls through the menus.

![menu-page](https://github.com/meganw22/Project1/assets/141934888/2de279fe-315f-42e5-b147-07fffde93f8b)

#### Contact us Page
the contact us page is displayed as one small heading section providing the contact details and one larger section containing the booking form. The booking form requires the user to correctly fill in the form to submit. The user is supported by prompts if a bit of text is not entered correctly. An image is placed within the proximity of the form to provide colour and positive user experience as well as tempting them again with a menu item.

## Bug Fixes
During the creation of the website, class and id selectors were created during the initial flow of coding. I found that as I progressed with my code and built more intricate code that flow broke up. This resulted with splitting up and specifying more particular code to match the styles required on each page. For example, before; I used "class=img-wrapper" to wrap all images to the right of the body of text in each section. As I progressed, I found on occasion I was renaming id selectors as class selectors in CSS and not renaming the selectors in the html code. This resulted in large errors in responsivity and incorrectly displayed webpages resulting in sideways swiping to occur to see the full content.

## Deployment
The cloud based server used to create the Ocean Café website was GitHub. The following steps were completed in order to deploy the project to a hosting platform:
 1. Login to GitHub and selection of the required Project file, 'meganw22/Project1'
 2. Along the menu tab, selected 'Settings', navigated to heading 'code and automation', and selected 'Pages'
 3. Ensured the 'Source' was selected as 'Deploy from branch' and 'Branch' was selected as 'main'/ (root).  
 5. Once saved and after waiting a few minutes, returned to the 'code' tab and found the deployed site ready to open.
 6. Find the deployed webpage link here: https://meganw22.github.io/Project1/
