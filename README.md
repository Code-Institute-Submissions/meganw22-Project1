# Ocean Café, Hertford

Welcome to the website for Ocean Café, based in Hertford, UK. This is a local breakfast and lunch café website designed to attract an audience to dine at the Café.

## User Experience
The primary goal of the Ocean Café website is to provide a good user experience which will ultimately attract the viewer to the Café.
### Ease of Use  
A positive response can be found through the websites ease of use; the website is easy to navigate for a first-time user and can provide bold information for the user to view.  
Ease of use is also applied through the websites ability to be viewed on all screen sizes, this allows the user to comfortably view the website easily and happily without struggling to view the content.
### Customer Expectations
As a customer, you would expect to see the basic elements of a café website: Menu, contact details, location, opening times and means of booking. All of which have been provided across the three webpages created, Home, Menu and Contact us.  
_Note – As this is a fictional café, the exact address location of the café is unavailable, but the town location is specified._

## Design

## Deployment
The cloud based server used to create the Ocean Café website was GitHub. The following steps were completed in order to deploy the project to a hosting platform:
 1. Login to GitHub and selection of the required Project file, 'meganw22/Project1'
 2. Along the menu tab, selected 'Settings', navigated to heading 'code and automation', and selected 'Pages'
 3. Ensured the 'Source' was selected as 'Deploy from branch' and 'Branch' was selected as 'main'/ (root).  
 5. Once saved and after waiting a few minutes, returned to the 'code' tab and found the deployed site ready to open.
 6. Find the deployed webpage link here: https://meganw22.github.io/Project1/
